# Module 1: Development Environment Setup

[‚Üê Back to Course](../) | [üìö Next: Module 2](MODULE_02_VUE_FOUNDATION.html)

**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Branch:** `feature/module-1-setup`

## Learning Objectives
- Configure a professional development environment
- Set up project structure following industry standards
- Establish version control workflow
- Configure environment variable management
- Prepare for team collaboration

## Overview
Before writing any code, you'll establish a solid foundation for development. This module focuses on tooling, project structure, and workflows that professional developers use daily.

## Tasks

### Task 1.1: VS Code Configuration
**Objective:** Set up VS Code with essential extensions for Vue/JavaScript development

**What you need to accomplish:**
- Install recommended VS Code extensions
- Configure workspace settings
- Set up code formatting and linting

**Documentation to consult:**
- [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode)
- [VS Code Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)

**Required extensions (minimum):**
- Vue Language Features (Volar)
- TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- ESLint
- Prettier
- GitLens

**Hints:**
- Create a `.vscode/extensions.json` file to recommend extensions to other developers
- Configure auto-format on save
- Set up consistent indentation (2 spaces for Vue/JS)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] All required extensions installed
- [ ] Workspace settings configured
- [ ] Code formatting works on save
- [ ] Vue files have proper syntax highlighting

## Implementation Guidance

### Getting Started
Before beginning this task, ensure you have:
- [ ] VS Code installed on your development machine
- [ ] Basic familiarity with VS Code interface
- [ ] Administrative privileges to install extensions

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach

**1. Extension Installation Process**
- Open VS Code Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
- Search for each required extension by exact name
- Install extensions one by one, restarting VS Code if prompted
- Verify each extension appears in your installed extensions list

**2. Workspace Configuration Setup**
- Create `.vscode` folder in your project root
- Add `settings.json` for workspace-specific settings
- Add `extensions.json` to recommend extensions to team members
- Configure formatting rules that align with project standards

**3. Auto-formatting Configuration**
- Enable "Format on Save" in VS Code settings
- Set Prettier as default formatter for JavaScript/Vue files
- Configure ESLint to work alongside Prettier
- Test formatting by creating a sample Vue file with messy formatting

**Key Decision Points:**
- **Global vs. Workspace settings:** Use workspace settings for project-specific rules, global for personal preferences
- **Extension conflicts:** If you have conflicting Vue extensions, disable older ones (like Vetur)
- **Formatting rules:** Choose between tabs vs. spaces (recommended: 2 spaces for Vue/JavaScript)

**Verification Steps:**
1. Create a test `.vue` file with incorrect formatting
2. Save the file and confirm it auto-formats
3. Check that syntax highlighting shows Vue template, script, and style sections in different colors
4. Verify IntelliSense suggestions appear when typing Vue directives

**Documentation to consult:**
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/)
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

**Hints:**
```bash
# Example .gitignore structure should include:
node_modules/
.env
.env.local
dist/
.DS_Store
*.log
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Proper .gitignore file created
- [ ] Initial commit made
- [ ] Remote repository connected (GitHub)
- [ ] README.md with project description

## Implementation Guidance

Before beginning this task, ensure you have:
- [ ] Git installed and configured globally (`git --version` works)
- [ ] GitHub account created and accessible
- [ ] SSH key or personal access token configured for GitHub
- [ ] Basic understanding of Git workflow concepts

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach

**1. Repository Initialization**
- Navigate to your project root directory in terminal
- Run `git init` to initialize the repository
- Check that `.git` folder was created (use `ls -la` to see hidden files)
- Configure local Git settings if not set globally

**2. .gitignore Configuration**
- Create `.gitignore` file in root directory
- Research what files Vue.js and Node.js projects typically ignore
- Include environment variables, build outputs, and system files
- Test that ignored files don't appear in `git status`

**3. Initial Repository Content**
- Create a meaningful README.md with project description and setup instructions
- Add any initial configuration files
- Stage files using `git add .` (verify with `git status`)
- Make first commit with descriptive message

**4. Remote Repository Connection**
- Create repository on GitHub with same name as local project
- Add remote origin using HTTPS or SSH URL
- Push initial commit to establish connection
- Verify repository appears correctly on GitHub

**Key Decision Points:**
- **Repository visibility:** Choose public for portfolio projects, private for sensitive work
- **Commit message style:** Establish convention (conventional commits recommended)
- **Branch strategy:** Decide on main branch name and feature branch naming

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm `git status` shows clean working directory
2. Test that `.env` files are properly ignored
3. Verify you can push and pull from remote repository
4. Check that GitHub repository displays your README correctly
