# Module 2: Frontend Foundation with Vue 3

**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Branch:** `feature/module-2-vue-foundation`

## Application Context: TaskFlow Platform Foundation

### What You're Building
You're creating the foundational structure for **TaskFlow** - a collaborative task management platform similar to Trello or Asana. This module establishes the visual framework and navigation system that will support user authentication, project management, and team collaboration features in later modules.

### TaskFlow Features You're Building This Module
- **Landing page**: Modern, professional homepage with clear value proposition
- **Responsive navigation**: Header with logo, search, and user controls
- **Application layout**: Sidebar navigation + main content area structure  
- **Mobile-first design**: Hamburger menu and responsive breakpoints
- **Route structure**: Foundation for authentication and dashboard pages

### User Stories for This Module
- **As a visitor**, I want to see an attractive landing page so that I understand what TaskFlow offers
- **As a user**, I want intuitive navigation so that I can easily move between different areas of the application
- **As a mobile user**, I want a responsive interface so that I can use TaskFlow on any device

### UI Mockups Reference
ðŸ“‹ **See detailed visual mockups**: [Module 2 UI Mockups](../mockups/MODULE_02_MOCKUPS.md)

The mockups show the complete landing page design, responsive navigation patterns, and mobile menu implementations you'll be building.

## Learning Objectives
- Initialize a modern Vue 3 application with Vite

## Overview
This module establishes the frontend foundation using Vue 3's Composition API, modern build tooling with Vite, and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. You'll create the visual structure that will house TaskFlow's project management features.

## Tasks

### Task 2.1: Vue 3 Project Initialization
**Objective:** Create a new Vue 3 project with Vite and configure the development environment

**What you need to accomplish:**
- Initialize Vue 3 project using Vite
- Configure project structure within your monorepo
- Set up development server with hot reload
- Configure basic build process

**Documentation to consult:**
- [Vue.js Getting Started](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html)
- [Vite Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [Vue CLI vs Vite](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html)

**Commands to explore:**
```bash
# In your client/ directory
npm create vue@latest .
# or
yarn create vue .
```

**Configuration considerations:**
- Choose No for TypeScript support (we'll introduce TypeScript in later modules)
- Include Vue Router (Yes - essential for SPA navigation)
- Include ESLint for code quality (Yes)
- Skip PWA features for now (No)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Vue 3 project successfully created
- [ ] Development server runs without errors
- [ ] Hot reload functionality working
- [ ] Project integrates with existing folder structure
- [ ] Initial commit made with project scaffold

## Implementation Guidance

### Getting Started
Before beginning this task, ensure you have:
- [ ] Node.js LTS version (20.x or later) installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] Module 1 development environment setup completed with npm scripts configured
- [ ] Understanding of Vue 3 vs Vue 2 differences
- [ ] Basic familiarity with modern JavaScript (ES6+)

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach

**1. Project Initialization Planning**
- Navigate to your `client/` directory (or create it if needed)
- Research the `npm create vue@latest` command options
- Plan which features to include during scaffold:
  - TypeScript: No (we'll add it in advanced modules)
  - Vue Router: Yes (required for navigation)
  - ESLint: Yes (for code quality)
  - Prettier: Yes (for consistent formatting)
  - Vitest: No (we'll add testing later)
- Consider how this integrates with your existing monorepo structure from Module 1

**2. Vue Project Creation Process**
- Run the Vue creation command in your client directory:
  ```bash
  cd client/
  npm create vue@latest .
  ```
- When prompted, select:
  - Project name: `taskflow-client`
  - TypeScript: No
  - JSX Support: No
  - Vue Router: Yes
  - Pinia: No (we'll use simple state management for now)
  - Vitest: No
  - End-to-End Testing: No
  - ESLint: Yes
  - Prettier: Yes
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Review generated folder structure:
  ```
  client/
  â”œâ”€â”€ public/          # Static assets
  â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/      # Images, fonts, etc.
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/  # Vue components
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ router/      # Vue Router config
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/       # Page components
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.vue      # Root component
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js      # Application entry point
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # HTML template
  â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js   # Vite configuration
  â””â”€â”€ package.json     # Dependencies and scripts
  ```

**3. Development Server Configuration**
- Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- The server will start on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port)
- **Understanding Hot Module Replacement (HMR):**
  - HMR allows you to see changes instantly without losing application state
  - When you edit a `.vue` file, only that component reloads
  - CSS changes apply immediately without page refresh
  - Try editing `src/App.vue` and watch the browser update automatically
- Configure Vite for backend integration in `vite.config.js`:
  ```javascript
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
      port: 3000,  // Change from default 5173 to 3000
      proxy: {
        '/api': {
          target: 'http://localhost:5000',  // Your Express backend from Module 1
          changeOrigin: true,
          secure: false
        }
      }
    }
  })
  ```
- Test the build process:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
  ```

**4. Project Integration with Module 1 Setup**
- Update your root `package.json` scripts to manage both server and client:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "npm run dev:server & npm run dev:client",
      "dev:server": "cd server && npm run dev",
      "dev:client": "cd client && npm run dev",
      "build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server",
      "build:client": "cd client && npm run build",
      "build:server": "cd server && npm run build",
      "start": "cd server && npm start"
    }
  }
  ```
- Set up environment variables for the Vue app:
  1. Create `client/.env.development`:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
     VITE_APP_NAME=TaskFlow
     ```
  2. Access in Vue components:
     ```javascript
     const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
     ```
- Ensure Git integration:
  - The Vue project should already be part of your monorepo
  - Check that `client/node_modules` is in `.gitignore`
  - Verify `client/dist` (build output) is also ignored
- Test concurrent development:
  ```bash
  # From root directory
  npm run dev  # Should start both server and client
  ```

**Key Decision Points:**
- **TypeScript adoption:** Skip for now to focus on Vue fundamentals - we'll add it in Module 7
- **Router inclusion:** Essential for SPA navigation (always choose Yes)
- **State management (Pinia):** Not needed yet - we'll use component state for now
- **Testing framework:** Skip for initial setup - we'll add testing in Module 6
- **Code quality tools:** Always include ESLint and Prettier for consistent code

**Verification Steps:**
1. Confirm `npm run dev` starts development server on port 3000
2. Test Hot Module Replacement:
   - Edit text in `src/App.vue` - should update instantly
   - Change styles - should apply without refresh
   - Add a new component - should hot reload
3. Verify build process:
   - Run `npm run build` - should create `dist/` folder
   - Check `dist/` contains optimized HTML, JS, and CSS files
   - Run `npm run preview` to test production build
4. Test monorepo integration:
   - From root: `npm run dev` starts both server and client
   - API proxy works: `fetch('/api/health')` reaches your Express server
   - Environment variables load correctly
